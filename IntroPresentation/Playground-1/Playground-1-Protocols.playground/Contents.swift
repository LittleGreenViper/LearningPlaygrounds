// You define a protocol in much the same way that you define a class or a struct, except that you do not provide any "body" to the methods or properties
protocol A {
    var someVar: String { get } // The "get" means that you (as a user of a class or struct conforming to the protocol) can only read from the property. You can't write to it.
    var someOtherVar: String { get set }    // You can read and write to this property. That means that calculated properties need to have both a "get" and a "set" handler.
    func someFunc() -> Bool // You define a method/function as a "bald" declaration.
}

// You can inherit a protocol. B has the same requirements as A, plus any that it adds.

// Protocol C, on the other hand, cannot be applied to structs or enums; only classes. Other protocols can inherit it, but then they need to be class protocols, as well.
