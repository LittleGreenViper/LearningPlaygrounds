// Standard Swift Collections
// The Swift Standard Library comes with three basic collection types: Array, Dictionary, Set. They are generic, and will aggregate any type of Swift objects.
// Swift standard collections are value semantic. They aggregate copies of data; not references. You should keep this in mind when using them.
// Array
// Arrays are linear, ordered collections that aggregate data in the order they are stored. Access to Array data is via integer position indexes or iteration.

// Let's set up an Array of Strings:
var stringArray = ["Eeny", "Meeny", "Miney", "Moe"]

// All collections have a "count" calculated property that indicates how many items it stores:
print(stringArray.count)    // Prints "4"

// Arrays can have their contents directly accessed via a 0-based index/subscript:
print(stringArray[2])   // Prints "Miney"

// Or they can iterate via a loop:
for element in stringArray {    // Prints "Eeny\nMeeny\nMiney\nMoe\n"
    print(element)
}

// Or they can be iterated using higher-order functions:
stringArray.forEach { print($0) }                   // Prints "Eeny\nMeeny\nMiney\nMoe\n"
print(stringArray.map { (element) -> Character in   // Prints ["E", "M", "M", "M"]
    return element[element.startIndex]
})
print(stringArray.reduce("") { current, new in      // Prints "Eeny, Meeny, Miney, Moe"
    return current + (!current.isEmpty ? ", " : "") + new
})

// Here's a simple proof that they are value semantics:
let newArray = stringArray
print(newArray) // Prints ["Eeny", "Meeny", "Miney", "Moe"]
stringArray[2] = "Money"
print(stringArray) // Prints ["Eeny", "Meeny", "Money", "Moe"]
print(newArray) // Prints ["Eeny", "Meeny", "Miney", "Moe"]

// All collections also have an "isEmpty" flag, that is true, if there are zero items:
print(stringArray.isEmpty)  // Prints "false"

stringArray = []

print(stringArray.isEmpty)  // Prints "true"

// Dictionary
// Dictionaries are a standard hash table, random-access aggregator type.
// You set up a Dictionary by defining it as Dictionary<AnyHashable, Any>, or [AnyHashable: Any]
// For example, if you were creating a Dictionary of integers, with String keys, you would define it as Dictionary<String, Int> or [String: Int]
var integerDictionary = ["Two": 2, "One": 1, "Four": 4, "Zero": 0, "Three": 3]
// Which is exactly the same as:
//var integerDictionary: [String: Int] = ["Two": 2, "One": 1, "Four": 4, "Zero": 0, "Three": 3]
// or
//var integerDictionary: Dictionary<String, Int> = ["Two": 2, "One": 1, "Four": 4, "Zero": 0, "Three": 3]

// With a Dictionary, you access items directly, using a hash (O1 complexity):
print(integerDictionary["Three"] ?? "ERROR")   // Prints "3"
// Note the nil-coalescing operator (??). That's there, because the lookup could fail. The return type is Int?. If that happens, you get nil. Let's try a failure:
print(integerDictionary["Five"] ?? "ERROR")   // Prints "ERROR"

// The order of the stored items is not guaranteed. A straight printing could yield inconsistent results:
print(integerDictionary)    // Almost certainly will not print ["Zero": 0, "One": 1, "Two": 2, "Three": 3, "Four": 4] or ["Two": 2, "One": 1, "Four": 4, "Zero": 0, "Three": 3]

// You can iterate Dictionaries via higher-order functions.
// The order of the following will be undefined. They will be similar to above.
integerDictionary.forEach { print("\($0.key) = \($0.value)") }   // Since we are iterating a Dictionary, each element is actually a tuple (key: String, value: Int)
print(integerDictionary.map { (element) -> Int in   // Transform to an Array of Int, using map
    return element.value
})
print(integerDictionary.reduce("") { current, new in
    return current + (!current.isEmpty ? ", " : "") + String(new.value)
})

// Or with a standard for in iterator (again, order is not defined):
for element in integerDictionary {
    print("\(element.key) = \(element.value)")
}

// Dictionaries have an Array of Dictionary.Keys type that is called "keys":
var keyArray = integerDictionary.keys
print("Raw: \(keyArray)")

// You can use this to impose some kind of order on the Dictionary.
// You can't do sorts on Dictionaries or Sets; only Arrays.
// This blunt-instrument stupid sort will only work for five sequential values. Don't try this at home.
var sortedKeys = (keyArray.map { return String($0) } as [String]).sorted { return ("Four" == $1) || ("Zero" == $0) || ("One" == $0 && "Zero" != $1) || ("Two" == $0 && "Three" == $1) }

print("Sorted: \(sortedKeys)")

sortedKeys.forEach {
    print(integerDictionary[$0] ?? "ERROR")
}

// Set
// Sets look like unordered Arrays, with a twist: You can't repeat values in a Set, and the values have to be hashable.
// A Set is a keyless hash table; where the value itself is hashed.
// Use a set to force uniqueness, or quickly match for membership.
// A hash lookup is a O(1) operation, while an Array search could be as high as O(n), if you are simply looking for membership (contains() function).
// Since a Set assignment looks exactly like an Array assignment, you need to explicitly indicate that this is a Set:
// Note that we didn't need to indicate Set<String>. That was inferred by Swift (that's what I mean by Swift "hiding" generics).
var integerNameSet: Set = ["Two", "One", "Four", "Zero", "Three", "Zero"]   // Note that we added "Zero" twice, but it will only be in the Set once (look at the print).

print(integerNameSet)   // Since the Set is unordered, this will almost certainly not print ["Two", "One", "Four", "Zero", "Three"]

// You use "contains()" to find membership:
print(integerNameSet.contains("Three")) // Prints "true"
print(integerNameSet.contains("Five"))  // Prints "false"

// There's a whole bunch of other useful operations for sets, like unions, intersections, differences, etc. We won't cover that, here.
// However, we will cover one very useful aspect of Sets. Remember that we added "Zero" twice, above, but it only came up once?
// We'll use that to enforce uniqueness.
// Let's create a String Array with a few repeats:
let repeatingArray = ["Two", "Two", "Three", "One", "Four", "Zero", "Three", "Zero"]
// We didn't need to specify that it was an [String], as the compiler implies this.
// Now, we assign it to a Set:
let filteredSet = Set(repeatingArray)

// In the printout, see the differences between the two:
print(repeatingArray)
print(filteredSet)

// Now, we can use the sorting ability from before, to create a unique, sorted Array from that random, repeated input:
let filteredAndSortedArray = [String](filteredSet).sorted { return ("Four" == $1) || ("Zero" == $0) || ("One" == $0 && "Zero" != $1) || ("Two" == $0 && "Three" == $1) }
print(filteredAndSortedArray)

// PART 1: SPECIFYING RANGES AND INTERVALS
// 1.1: RANGES

// First, we look at the Range type. Ranges are designed for incrementing. They have to be scalar (incrementable, usually, integers).

// Basically, I don't think we should use multi-character strings in intervals. The behavior seems undefined.

// PART 3: STRIDES

// Strides are sort of a Range. They are mostly used to iterate for loops. Use a stride to iterate in "jumps," or to iterate backwards (Ranges cannot be defined in reverse).

let randallFlagg:StrideTo<Int> = stride ( from: 0, to: 6, by: 3 )   /* StrideTo is a "half open" Range. It does not include the last value. */

for i2 in aragorn
{
    print ( "i2 is \(i2)" )
}

// We can also use Strides to iterate backwards.

let frodo:StrideThrough<Int> = stride ( from: 6, through: 0, by: -3 )

for i3 in frodo
{
    print ( "i3 is \(i3)" )
}

// You can implicitly type the strides.
let bubbaThrough = stride ( from: 1, through: 5, by: 1 )

for bub in bubbaThrough
{
    print( "Bubba be \(bub)" )
}

let bubbaTo = stride ( from: 0, to: 5, by: 2 )

for bub in bubbaTo
{
    print( "Bubba be \(bub)" )
}

// Strides are often defined directly in the loop declarations.

for bub in stride ( from: 6, through: 0, by: -2 )
{
    print( "Bubba be \(bub)" )
}

// You can define a nonsensical stride, but it won't result in any loop executions.
let bubbaBad = stride ( from: 0, to: 5, by: -2 )

for bub in bubbaBad
{
    print( "Bubba be bad: \(bub)" )
}

// One advantage of Strides, is that you can increment in floating point steps.
let strideFloat:StrideTo<Float> = stride ( from: Float(0), to: 5, by: 2.1 )

for i4 in strideFloat
{
    print( "i4 is \(i4)" )
}

// These are the basics of the Range, Interval and Stride types, but there's a lot more depth to this rabbit hole...

// PART 4: Range Generators (SequenceType)

// Range generators are basically iterators. Iterable classes can spit out a generator, which is basically a disposable iterator.

// This example came from here: http://schani.wordpress.com/2014/06/03/playing-with-swift/

let arr = [1, 2, 3]

for x in arr
{
    print ( x )
}

// Which is really...

var arrGen = arr.makeIterator()

while let x = arrGen.next()
{
    print ( x )
}

// Try the same thing with a dictionary.

let uncleBobIsCool = [ "A":1, "B":2, "C":3, "D":4, "E":5 ]

for x in uncleBobIsCool
{
    print ( x )
}

var dictGen = uncleBobIsCool.makeIterator()

while let x = dictGen.next()
{
    print ( x )
}

// This is an example I plucked from here: http://sketchytech.blogspot.com/2014/08/swift-adopt-sequence-protocol-and-use.html

// This shows how to create a simple struct-based iterator.

// SequenceType is a struct (not a class), and requires a GeneratorType-based struct as a typealias
struct MySequence:Sequence
{
    var x, y, length:Int    // These are the hypothetical struct data members.
    
    // The SequenceType protocol dictates that we have a generate() method that emits a GeneratorType-based struct.
    // Swift is kinda cool, in that you can define a typealias as a required prototype component.
    typealias GeneratorType = MyGenerator
    
    // This function instantiates a generator object, and returns that.
    // Since this is a struct, the object is a struct, and is returned by value.
    // That means that this object will not be affected by the iterator.
    func makeIterator() -> GeneratorType
    {
        // Length indicates how many iterations will be allowed.
        // The other two parameters are the starting values of the data members.
        return MyGenerator ( x:x, y:y, length:length )
    }
    
    mutating func next() -> GeneratorType.Element? {
        if length == 0 {
            return nil
        } else {
            length -= 1
            x += 1
            y += 1
            return ( x, y )
        }
    }
}

// This struct models one generator object.
// The generator is a "disposable" instance that is created by an instance of MySequence.
// The GeneratorType protocol requires a generic type, called "Element," which can be anything you want,
// and a "next()" method that returns one of the "Element" instances.
struct MyGenerator:IteratorProtocol
{
    var x, y, length:Int    // These are the values
    
    typealias Element = ( Int, Int )    // In the case of this example, "Element" is a tuple, containing x and y Int values.
    
    // This is the required next() method. Since this is a struct, we need the "mutating" keyword.
    mutating func next() -> Element?    // The return is optional, as we return nil when done.
    {
        // We just go for as many counts as "length" gave us, incrementing the values as we go.
        if length > 0
        {
            length -= 1
            x += 1
            y += 1
            return ( x, y )
        }
        else
        {
            return nil  // At the end, we return nil.
        }
    }
}

var seq = MySequence ( x:10, y:10, length:10 )

for point in seq
{
    print ( point )
}

// We can go again without a rewind.
// Note the data member values are at the old starting point.
// That's because internally, a new generator is created.

for point in seq
{
    print ( point )
}

// Let's create a new instance.
seq = MySequence ( x:10, y:10, length:10 )

// This is what's going on inside.
// Note that we need a "var", as we are mutating the struct.
var seqGen = seq.makeIterator()

// Since we generated a new generator, we start from the beginning again.
while let x = seqGen.next()
{
    print ( x )
}

// Now, if we try to go again, we won't have any luck.
while let x = seqGen.next()
{
    print ( x )
}

// However, if we reset length in the generator, we can go again, continuing to increment the values.
seqGen.length = 10

while let x = seqGen.next()
{

}

// Just to prove that the original instance remains untouched.
print ( "x: \( seq.x ), y: \( seq.y ), length: \( seq.length )" )

// Ranges, and Strides
//: Ranges (Open-Ended) can be empty
let rangeIsEmpty = (0..<0).isEmpty
//: ClosedRanges cannot be empty.
let closedRangeIsEmpty = (0...0).isEmpty

//: This will cause a nasty error. Uncomment to see the error.

let onwardAndUpward2 = -10...10 // This is a closed Range, from -10 to 10, in integer steps (20 steps, 21 values).

//: You cannot specify Ranges backwards. This will cause an error.
//let downwardSpiral = 1>..0

//: You can specify Ranges and ClosedRanges as Int:
let openIntRange = 0..<10
let closedIntRange = 0...10
//: You can specify Ranges and ClosedRanges as Float:
let openFloatRange = 0.0..<1.0
let closedFloatRange = 0.0...1.0
//: And even as Strings:
let openStringRange = "aardvark"..<"zebra"
let closedStringRange = "aardvark"..."zebra"
//: This will work, as Int has discrete, iterable steps:
for integ in openIntRange {
    print(integ)
}
//: These will not work, because Doubles and Strings don't have discrete steps:
//for fl in openFloatRange {
//    print(fl)
//}
//for animal in openStringRange {
//    print(animal)
//}
//: Now, let's do a simple Int switch.
//: Pay close attention to what happens here:
let someNumber = 3
switch someNumber {
case openIntRange:
    //: It will get caught here. 3 is within both Ranges, so the first match gets it.
